Ingredient is an open source lightweight CSS styling framework. It's a component library to get you quickly started on that dream project of yours without spending on the grunt work of resetting, basic styling, layouts. The entire library is formed keeping in mind the needs of an average developer to quickly spin apps while focusing on business logic and not on styling. Styling needs? We got you covered. With out custom components and utility classes, you'll start making web apps in non time.

## Usage
In order to introduce Ingredient to your project, Copy the link given below and paste it in the head tag of your html, above all other style sheets.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://ingredient.netlify.app/css/main.css">
## Alternative
Add the following import to your CSS file at the top before all other CSS file imports.

    @import url("https://ingredient.netlify.app/css/main.css");
## Directory
Now that you've imported the library to your project, you'll need some help from us to get yourself going. Fret not. We at Ingredients have put together a good documentation site for you to refer to and even copy the boiler plate code to use our components. You can always override and build upon the base components or utility class that we provide.
